<h1>RandomSierpinski</h1>
<p>A fairly simple program inspired by the <a href="https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs">Numberphile video</a> on a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">Chaos Game</a>. Since it was written using Tkinter it's not the prettiest GUI, but it proves the concept pretty well.</p>
